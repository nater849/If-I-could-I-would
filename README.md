# If-I-could-I-would
App ideas - 

Social Media Filter - If I could make a basic web app, I would want to make a social media filter of some kind. For example, I may follow an account on twitter because I enjoy their posts, but on some occasions they will re-tweet things irrelevant to their original content. I find this frustrating, and I'm sure others feel the same way. If i were to build this specifically for twitter, it would be able to filter out  irrelevant re-posts.

Active Guitar Tabs - I would like to make an interactie guitar tabs app. I use guitar tabs to learn songs, but I often have to scroll down on a webpage to see more lines. In this app I was thinking if someone made a tab, it could scroll along with a song file beat by beat or line by line, similar to a sing along video for a disney animated musical. If it were to go line by line, I think it would be good to have the line being played to be highlighted.

JSON Object - 

//Active Guitar Tabs - 
var tab = new Object();
tab.feature1= "auto scroll";
tab.feature2= "highlight";
tab.feature3= "play music files";
tab.feature4= "custom configuration";
person.printName = function() {
   console.log();
};
tab.line = new Object();
tab.line.highlightcolor = "yellow"; 
tab.line.configurebass1 = "4 lines";
tab.line.configurebass2 = "5 lines";
tab.line.configureguitar1 = "6 lines";
tab.line.configureguitar2 = "7 lines";
tab.line.configureguitat3 = "12 lines";

alert(JSON.stringify(tab));
