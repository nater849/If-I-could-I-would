# If-I-could-I-would
App idea - 
If I could make a basic web app, I would want to make a social media filter of some kind. For example, I may follow an account on twitter because I enjoy their posts, but on some occasions they will re-tweet things irrelevant to their original content. I find this frustrating, and I'm sure others feel the same way. If i were to build this specifically for twitter, it would be able to filter out  irrelevant re-posts.
