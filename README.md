# If-I-could-I-would
App ideas - 

If I could make a basic web app, I would want to make a social media filter of some kind. For example, I may follow an account on twitter because I enjoy their posts, but on some occasions they will re-tweet things irrelevant to their original content. I find this frustrating, and I'm sure others feel the same way. If i were to build this specifically for twitter, it would be able to filter out  irrelevant re-posts.

I would like to make an interactie guitar tabs app. I use guitar tabs to learn songs, but I often have to scroll down on a webpage to see more lines. In this app I was thinking if someone made a tab, it could scroll along with a song file beat by beat or line by line, similar to a sing along video for a disney animated musical. If it were to go line by line, I think it would be good to have the line being played to be highlighted.
